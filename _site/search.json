My research delves into the intricacies of how governments work together to solve complex challenges that transcend jurisdictional boundaries. Specifically, I explore the dynamics within decentralized local systems and their interconnections, examining the ways in which local governments leverage various institutional frameworks to address issues that extend beyond their immediate administrative borders.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am also a member of the Network and Governance Lab with a bunch of awesome researchers diving into all sorts of cool stuff!
