My research focuses on collaborative governance, regional intergovernmental organizations, and social network analysis. My research primarily investigates the mechanisms through which governments collaboratively address complex, cross-boundary challenges. I focus on the dynamics of decentralized local systems and their networks, probing how local governments utilize diverse institutional arrangements to tackle issues beyond local administrative limits.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am also a member of the Network and Governance Lab with a bunch of awesome researchers diving into all sorts of cool stuff!
