    "text": "Regional Intergovernmental Organizations (RIGOs)\n\n\n\nRIGOs in Iowa and their member local governments\n\n\nThe fragmented and decentralized local system in the US, presents significant challenges for local governments addressing public problems that across local boundaries or beyond the capabilities of individual governments (Savitch & Vogel, 2000; Norris, 2001; Bryan & Wolf, 2010). To overcome these challenges, local governments have developed a variety of approaches to enable collective action such as interlocal agreements, informal policy networks, regional institutions, and special districts (Hamilton et al., 2004; Bollens, 1997; Paytas, 2002; Foster & Barnes, 2011; Kim et al., 2020). Regional Intergovernmental Organizations (RIGOs) have emerged as one of the major approaches for fostering interlocal collaboration, improving the efficiency of regional public service provision and strategically managing federal and state resources (Miller & Nelles, 2020).\nRIGO is a theoretical term developed by Miller and Nelles (2018) referring to the cross-boundary organizations made up of local governments designed to coordinate decisions in multiple policy areas and to manage the collective interests of its members [learn more about RIGOs].\n\nRelated projects in progress:\n\nCan Regional Intergovernmental Organizations foster local public service collaborations? Evidence from a longitudinal causal analysis\nThe Role of the Nonprofit Sector among Regional Intergovernmental Organizations: A Mixed Method Study.\nHow do the decision-making structures of regional intergovernmental organizations affect regional policy decisions?\nUnpacking the institutional complexity of regional intergovernmental organizations in the Chicago metropolitan area.\nOrganizational Identity of Regional Inter-Governmental Organizations: An Empirical Investigation Using Q-Methodology."

    "text": "Local Public Service Networks\n\nThe UIC-NGL-IOWA intergovernmental agreements networks dataset\nThe Network and Governance Lab (NGL) at UIC is involved in a long-term project examining the creation, structure, composition, and performance of networks created by local governments to produce public services and coordinate policy actions. These projects examine both human networks that function within and across public organizations as well as interorganizational networks containing government, private and nonprofit actors\nAn important element of this project is the creation of the UIC-NGL-IOWA intergovernmental agreements networks dataset. This dataset was built using data on 28E agreements filed with the Iowa Secretary of State after 1993 and captures agreements covering 33 service areas. NGL updates the dataset annually to add new agreements and document changes in exiting agreements. A publicly available version of the data will coming soon.  For more information click here.\n\n\n\nAccountability Choices in Service Contracts for Collaborative Public Safety Services Provision\n\n\n\nRelated projects in progress:\n\nExploring Accountability Choices in Service Contracts for Collaborative Public Safety Services Provision [finished].

Evidence from a Longitudinal Study.\n\n\n\n\nChicago Public Health PONs\nAs of March 2024, researchers at UIC’s Networks and Governance Lab have identified over 65 community health and wellness collaborative groups within Chicago and Cook County. These groups, involving more than 800 public and private sector organizations, play a pivotal role in addressing the health and wellness needs of our diverse communities surrounding UIC. For more information click here.\nThese collaborative groups are Purpose-Oriented Networks (PONs), representing a critical mechanism for tackling complex public health issues through collaborative interorganizational efforts. Despite the wealth of research across various disciplines on interorganizational networks, the influence of an external environment on a network’s long-term sustainability and effectiveness remains underexplored (Nowell & Albrecht, 2023).\n\n\n\nChicago Public Health PONs\n\n\n\nRelated projects in progress:\n\nWhat are the characteristics differentiating organizations bridging public health networks from those that are not?"

    "text": "Social Network Analysis\nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) is a dynamic method for examining social structures by employing the principles of networks and graph theory. It elucidates the intricate patterns of interaction within networked systems, distinguishing between the entities (nodes) such as individual actors, people, or elements, and the connections (ties, edges, or links) that bind them.\nKey applications of SNA span various domains, my research focuses on the following context:\n\nPersonal Relationships: studying the networks of friendships, acquaintances, and professional contacts.\nCollaborative Networks: understanding cooperative interactions in various settings.\n\nThese networks are typically visualized through sociograms, where nodes are depicted as points and ties as lines. Such visual representations are invaluable for qualitatively analyzing networks, allowing variations in node and edge appearances to highlight relevant attributes, thereby offering deeper insights into the structure and dynamics of the network.\n\nRelated projects in progress:\n\nExploring the Relationship Between Substance Use and the Development of Friendships among American Indian Adolescents: Using the Exponential Random Graph Model (Project supported by National Institutes of Health: 5R21DA053789).\nSocial Networks in American Indian Youth; A cross-sectional exploratory analysis of school-based, family-based, and other peers among 9th and 10th graders on one large plains reservation.
