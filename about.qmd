I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Public Administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My research focuses on collaborative governance, regional intergovernmental organizations, and social network analysis. My research primarily investigates the mechanisms through which governments collaboratively address complex, cross-boundary challenges. I focus on the dynamics of decentralized local systems and their networks, probing how local governments utilize diverse institutional arrangements to tackle issues beyond local administrative limits.
